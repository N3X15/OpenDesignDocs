Title: Return of Metroids

This is a project for /vg/station to return Metroids, which were removed during a rebase to Bay+TG code.  Metroids became slimes at that time, but there's some nostalgia for them.

**This document is open to pull requests and issue reports.**

# Legal Implications

Metroid-related materials are legally linked to Nintendo in a large number of ways, so we **MUST** find another name and likeness.  **Metroids** are a **working title** while we try to find alternatives.

While we don't find it likely that Nintendo would find us a threat due to the small community, we should still look for alternatives in case Nintendo breaks out the lawyers, as they have a history of such.

## Alternatives

### Criteria

In order for us to have an acceptable alternative, the following criteria must be met:

* Must not exist in the game already.
* Must not be a legal issue if used.
* Must operate mechanically similar as the Metroid concept outlined below.

### Rejected
* ~~**Roros**~~ - They were the first stab at this eons ago, but they were overwhelmingly awful in a number of ways, and their sprites looked like bald furbies.
* ~~**Slimes**~~ - Already exist, but are mechanically different in a number of ways, making them trivial to wrangle.
* ~~**Brain Slugs/Yeerks**~~ - While the idea is similar mechanically, we already have them in the form of cortical borers.
* ~~**Headcrabs**~~ - Property of Valve Software.
* ~~**Giant Spiders**~~ - Already exist as Bay's crappy answer to Xenomorphs.

### Possibilities

Feel free to make suggestions
* Space Lice - Lays eggs in the brain, feeds on blood.
* Polyps (Space Jellyfish) - When a carbon is stung, it implants a Polyp into their skull and starts slowly feeding from their brain (increasing brain damage) until it gets X amount and spawns a new jelly, resetting the counter. After Y seconds, the host is paralyzed and the polyp appears as a barnacle-like hat. Death of the host kills the polyp.

**In the event of legal action, we will have to move very quickly and will likely have to choose one of these before much discussion.**
